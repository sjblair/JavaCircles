Java Circles
==========

Inspired by Daniel Bernier's generative art which he dubbed [Circle Pictures](http://invisibleblocks.com/2014/09/29/circle-pictures-redux/ "Circle Pictures Redux"); I have created a Java wrapper for his code. His code was originally done in [Processing](https://processing.org/ "Processing Homepage"). Processing is based on Java but uses a simplified syntax and graphics programming model.

**Some notes about the code...**

To use this code you will need to have Processing on your Mac/PC. You will then need to add the core.jar file as a global library to your IDE of choice. At a later date I'll write how to do this in IntelliJ IDEA. If you already know how to do that then you can find core.jar here: `/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/core/library/core.jar`.
